			<p>Maize is probably one of the most important plants that we have.</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>Maize is thought to have been first cultivated in Mexico about 10-9 thousand years ago. It originally began as something that would barely pass for edible, but it was bred with other plants that brought it close to something that we have today. It spread across most of the America's due to its ability to grow in many different climates as well as its high yeild.</p>
			<h2>Contact with Old World</h2>
			<p>Corn was introduced to the colonizers in 1492, but the Spaniards initially disliked the food. They found that they could use it to make a flour similar to wheat, however, it would not rise. They disliked this flour as it was believed that only bread made from wheat would undergo the process of becoming the body of Chirst upon consumpsion. It was also believed that eating too much would cause them to become Indians. Despite this, corn was used as a major food source for the New World colonies.</p>
			<h2>Rise in America</h2>
			<p>In the American South, corn became a stable food, sometimes even being the only major food source for some. With all of this corn being eaten, a disease called pellagra began to rise. This disease became prevelant in the early 20th century, weakening the farmers. A few theories began to rise as to why this was happening. The main theory was that there was a defficiency in some nutrient, which turned out to be correct. Another theory proposed that it was caused by some type of germ that lived on corn. There was one more theory, but I will just link you to the wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Davenport">Charles Davenport</a> if you want to get a rough idea of what that was about. Pellagra was shown to be caused by a defficiency in niacin, a necessary nutrient. It was also discovered that the Natives of America had been mixing the corn in alkali water, fixing the defficiency. Once the solution was found, pellagra rates dropped sharply. It is now extremely rare in the developed world.</p>
			<h2>Other Uses</h2>
			<p>Many types of corn are difficult for humans to process due to their large starch content, making it difficult to digest. Because of this, a large portion of our corn production is used to create feed for animals. The amount used for food for people is a small fraction of the amount we use for other purposes. Corn is also one of the ingrediants you can use to make ethanol, a fuel similar to gasoline. Ethanol has an anti-knocking agent that helps car engines to keep from stopping. It replaced the previously used tetraethyl-lead, which was not fully phased out from gasoline until 1995. Until then, cars had been putting lead into the atmosphere that the people were breathing. We also cannot forget its use in making moonshine.</p>
			<h2>TLDR</h2>
			<p>Purchase corn and nothing more</p>
